This Github repository is hosting N7 Consulting, [ENSEEIHT](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/index.html)'s Junior-Entreprise, version of Jeyser. It is currently (27/10/2014) the only version of Incipio under active development. You can try a demo (resetted every hour) of Jeyser [Heroku](https://jeyser-demo.herokuapp.com/)
